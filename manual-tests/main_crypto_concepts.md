# Main CRYPTO concepts

## Blockchain

A distributed ledger technology that securely records data across multiple nodes, making it nearly impossible to alter without consensus. Each transaction is grouped into a block, and these blocks are linked in a chain, ensuring integrity and transparency.

## Smart Contract

A programmable contract that executes and enforces predefined rules automatically when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts run on blockchain networks, ensuring tamper-proof agreements without intermediaries.

## GAS Token

A utility token used to pay for computational resources on a blockchain network, such as transaction processing and contract execution. The amount of gas required varies depending on the complexity of the transaction or smart contract.

## ERC-20 Token

A widely adopted token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. This standard defines a set of rules for creating and managing fungible tokens, which can represent various digital assets such as currencies, points, or shares.

## Wallet

A tool, either software or hardware, that allows users to manage their cryptocurrencies. Wallets store private keys, enabling users to access their funds and authorize transactions securely.

## ChainPort Bridge

A cross-chain bridge that allows for the secure and seamless transfer of tokens between different blockchains. This technology maintains the value and functionality of the tokens as they move across networks, making interoperability between blockchains possible.
